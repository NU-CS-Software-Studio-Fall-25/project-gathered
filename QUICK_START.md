3. In window 2, refresh to see updated member count
4. _(Note: Real-time broadcasting would show instant updates without refresh)_

### Scenario 2: Creating Multiple Groups

1. View a course's study groups
2. Create a new group
3. Notice it appears at the top of the list
4. Create another â†’ both visible
5. All animations smooth

### Scenario 3: Validation Errors

1. Click "Create New Group"

## Routes Reference

```ruby
# View all courses
GET  /                                    # root_path

# View specific course (Turbo Frame or full page)
GET  /courses/:id                         # course_path(@course)

# Create study group form
GET  /courses/:course_id/study_groups/new # new_course_study_group_path(@course)

# Create study group
POST /courses/:course_id/study_groups     # course_study_groups_path(@course)

# View study group details
GET  /study_groups/:id                    # study_group_path(@study_group)

# Join a study group
POST /study_groups/:id/join               # join_study_group_path(@study_group)

# Leave a study group
DELETE /study_groups/:id/leave            # leave_study_group_path(@study_group)
```

## Simulating Current User

Currently, the app uses:

```ruby
Student.first&.student_id
```

This simulates being logged in as the first student.

### To Test as Different Users

In Rails console:

```ruby
# Find different student IDs
Student.pluck(:student_id, :name).first(5)

# Temporarily change in controller
# Replace Student.first with Student.find(specific_id)
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Why does clicking "View Study Groups" expand the card instead of navigating?

**A:** The link has `data: { turbo_frame: "course_X_details" }`, which tells Turbo to load the response into that specific frame.

### Q: How does the "Join Group" button update without JavaScript?

**A:** The button has `data: { turbo_stream: true }`. The server responds with Turbo Stream instructions that Hotwire's JavaScript (built-in) executes automatically.

### Q: What if I want to navigate to a full course page?

**A:** Visit `/courses/:id` directly in the URL bar, or remove the `turbo_frame` data attribute from the link.

### Q: Can I see the Turbo Stream response?

**A:** Yes! In DevTools Network tab, click a "Join Group" request, then view the Response tab. You'll see XML-like `<turbo-stream>` tags.
